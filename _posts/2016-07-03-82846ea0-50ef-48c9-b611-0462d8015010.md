Hi! My name is Matthew Steven Lanter and I'm a graphic designer working and living in Tempe, Arizona. I specialize in visual brand identities for small to mid-size businesses, but I also provide motion graphic, web design, illustration, and print design services. I'm deeply passionate for logo design, and I truly love the process involved in creating all that is unique for my clients.

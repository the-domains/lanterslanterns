  The new outdoor beer garden in Downtown Urbana, Illinois! This wordmark was
  created with shipping containers in mind, as the alley space will be filled
  with refurbished containers. I chose a bold, condensed, stencil typeface as it
  is a common site on the sides of shipping containers. The space created
  between the "P" and the"Y" was just begging to be filled, so an abstracted
  shipping container was used to fill the space. It also creates a nice
  separation between the two syllables of the name. Shipyard(shipping
  containers) + Sip(beer) + Yard(outdoor-only beer garden) = SIPYARD!
